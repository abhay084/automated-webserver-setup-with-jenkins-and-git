# automated-webserver-setup-with-jenkins-and-git

In this project I have created a automated pipeline for Apache webserver deployment. This pipeline is connected to the GitHub repository, so any change in the repository will be automatically detected and accordingly the webpage automatically gets modified. 

### Tool and Technology  used
* Git
* Jenkins
* Redhat Linux
* HTML & CSS
* Apache httpd webserver
